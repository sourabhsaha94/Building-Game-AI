AI movement algorithm categories:
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Kinematic seek (move towards target with max velocity)</li>
<li>Kinematic flee (move away target with max velocity)</li>
<li>Wander (move aimlessly while facing in direction of motion)</li>
<li>Arrive (move towards target with acceleration)</li>
<li>Flocking movement (using Boid's algorithm, simulation of flock of birds)</li>
<br/>

AI Pathfinding algorithms
<br/>
<ul>
<li>A * path-finding algorithm</li>
<li>Djikstra path-finding algorithm</li>
</ul>
These algorithms have been exectuted on the maps of USA and the world in order to measure the difference in runtime on small and extremely large graphs.
<br/>
A * has been used also to animate a character to path-find inside a simulated indoor environment
